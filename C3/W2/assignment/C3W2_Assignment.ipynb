    "# Week 2: Diving deeper into the BBC News archive\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! In this assignment you will be revisiting the [BBC News Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/learn-ai-bbc/overview), which contains 2225 examples of news articles with their respective labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "This time you will not only work with the tokenization process, but you will also create a classifier using specialized layers for text data such as Embedding and GlobalAveragePooling1D.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL GRADING OF YOUR ASSIGNMENT:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All cells are frozen except for the ones where you need to submit your solutions or when explicitly mentioned you can interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can add new cells to experiment but these will be omitted by the grader, so don't rely on newly created cells to host your solution code, use the provided places for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can add the comment # grade-up-to-here in any graded cell to signal the grader that it must only evaluate up to that point. This is helpful if you want to check if you are on the right track even if you are not done with the whole assignment. Be sure to remember to delete the comment afterwards!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid using global variables unless you absolutely have to. The grader tests your code in an isolated environment without running all cells from the top. As a result, global variables may be unavailable when scoring your submission. Global variables that are meant to be used will be defined in UPPERCASE.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To submit your notebook, save it and then click on the blue submit button at the beginning of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!"
